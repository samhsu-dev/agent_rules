# IDEA Document Template (Concepts & Terminology)

> A general-purpose template for “idea” documents in software/research projects. Focus on current concepts and terminology. Do not include implementation details, APIs, commands, or code samples.

## Concept Overview
- One-sentence conceptual position of the module/subsystem in the whole system.
- List the key concepts and link to the glossary below.

## Glossary
- Concept A: concise definition; purpose/scope (concept-level only).
- Concept B: concise definition; purpose/scope (concept-level only).
- Concept C: concise definition; purpose/scope (concept-level only).

## Concept Relationships & Boundaries
- Describe inclusion/containment/peer/constraint relationships among core concepts.
- Differentiate from adjacent/overlapping concepts to avoid ambiguity.

## Workflow Placement (Conceptual)
- Describe inputs/outputs and the role within the end-to-end workflow (conceptual only).
- Explain how it conceptually interfaces with upstream and downstream concepts (no implementation details).

## Typical Scenarios (Conceptual Examples)
- Scenario 1: business-level description of how concepts operate (no code/commands).
- Scenario 2: emphasize boundary conditions or exceptions at the concept level.

## Relationships to Other Modules (Conceptual)
- Conceptual interactions/dependencies with neighboring modules or domains (e.g., modeling, binding, execution, observation).
- Shared terminology and division of responsibilities to avoid duplication and confusion.

## Common Misconceptions & Clarifications
- Misconception X: clarification (conceptual explanation; no implementation guidance).
- Misconception Y: clarification.

## Further Reading
- For deeper design and implementation, refer to the corresponding design document (e.g., `design.md`) or architecture notes.
- Related research/standards (if any).

## Change Log (Optional)
- Notable adjustments at the concept/terminology level.
