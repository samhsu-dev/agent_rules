# Implementation Document Standards

## 1. Scope

- **Files**: `implementation.md` — one per design (e.g. `design.md` ↔ `implementation.md`). Same dir/naming as design; create if missing when implementing.
- **Role**: APIs, libraries, developer notes for realising the design. On task start: read paired `implementation.md` when implementing that design.
- **Format**: Headings + lists + inline code; one line per fact; no prose.

## 2. Structure

Sections in order; include only if they have content:

| Section | Content |
|--------|--------|
| **APIs** | `**[Lib]**` `snippet` — one-line when/gotcha. |
| **Libraries** | Name; version if fixed; purpose. One line each. |
| **Developer instructions** | Workflow, command, pattern, constraint. One fact per line. |
| **Design-specific** | Invariants, non-obvious behaviour, integration. If multiple designs: subheadings by design filename. |

## 3. When to write

- Design needs API → **APIs**. Design needs library → **Libraries**. Developer gives instruction → **Developer instructions**. User corrects → update immediately.
- Do not duplicate design (types, responsibilities). No long examples or tutorials.

## 4. Rules

- One to two lines per API; canonical import + when/gotcha. Remove lib when design no longer uses it.
- Developer instructions: concrete only; update/remove when workflow changes.
- On user correction: update the paired `implementation.md`; deduplicate; remove obsolete. Scope = implementation only; design stays in design file. Do not remove API/lib/instruction without user request or obsolescence.
