# IDEA Document Template (Concepts & Terminology)

> A general-purpose template for "idea" documents in software/research projects. Focus on current concepts and terminology. Do not include implementation details, interfaces, commands, or code samples.

## Concept Overview
- One-sentence conceptual position of the module/subsystem in the whole system
- List the key concepts and link to the glossary below
- Define the primary purpose and scope

## Glossary
- **Concept A**: concise definition; purpose/scope (concept-level only)
- **Concept B**: concise definition; purpose/scope (concept-level only)
- **Concept C**: concise definition; purpose/scope (concept-level only)

## Concept Relationships & Boundaries
- Describe inclusion/containment/peer/constraint relationships among core concepts
- Differentiate from adjacent/overlapping concepts to avoid ambiguity
- Define clear boundaries and responsibilities
- Identify shared concepts and their contexts

## Workflow Placement (Conceptual)
- Describe inputs/outputs and the role within the end-to-end workflow (conceptual only)
- Explain how it conceptually interfaces with upstream and downstream concepts (no implementation details)
- Define data flow and transformation concepts
- Identify integration points and dependencies

## Typical Scenarios (Conceptual Examples)
- **Scenario 1**: high-level description of how concepts operate (no code/commands)
- **Scenario 2**: emphasize boundary conditions or exceptions at the concept level
- **Scenario 3**: illustrate complex interactions between concepts

## Relationships to Other Modules (Conceptual)
- Conceptual interactions/dependencies with neighboring modules or components
- Shared terminology and division of responsibilities to avoid duplication and confusion
- Interface contracts and data exchange patterns
- Cross-module concept dependencies

## Common Misconceptions & Clarifications
- **Misconception X**: clarification (conceptual explanation; no implementation guidance)
- **Misconception Y**: clarification
- **Misconception Z**: clarification

## Design Principles
- Core design principles that guide concept implementation
- Architectural patterns and their conceptual basis
- Quality attributes and their conceptual implications
- Trade-offs and design decisions at the concept level

## Evolution & Future Considerations
- How concepts might evolve over time
- Potential extensions or modifications
- Backward compatibility considerations
- Migration strategies for concept changes

## Further Reading
- For deeper design and implementation, refer to the corresponding design document (e.g., `design.md`) or architecture notes
- Related research/standards (if any)
- External references and documentation
- Related concepts in other components

## Change Log (Optional)
- Notable adjustments at the concept/terminology level
- Evolution of concepts over time
- Deprecated concepts and their replacements
- Lessons learned and concept refinements
