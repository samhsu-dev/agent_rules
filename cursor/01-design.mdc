# Design Documentation Standards

## Class Documentation Template
**[ClassName] Class**
- **Responsibility**: [Single sentence purpose]
- **Properties**: `property: type` - Brief description
- **[method_name(param: type) -> return_type]**
  - **Behavior**: [What it does]
  - **Input**: [Parameter description]
  - **Output**: [Return description]
  - **Raises**: [Exception conditions]
- **Example Usage**: Include minimal working example

## Exception Classes
**[ExceptionName]**: [When raised]

## Validation Rules
**[Component] Validation**:
- [Validation rule]

## Design Change Policy
- No legacy design details when design changes
- No backward compatibility requirements
- All designs can be rebuilt from scratch
- No existing component compatibility requirements

## Design Modification Restrictions
- Never modify existing design without explicit user authorization
- Preserve original design intent and structure
- Do not change return types, parameter signatures, or method behaviors without user request
- Do not add, remove, or rename methods unless explicitly instructed
- Maintain exact interface compatibility unless user specifically requests changes

## Design Principles
### Single Responsibility
- Each class should have one reason to change
- Methods should perform a single, well-defined task
- Avoid god classes that handle multiple concerns

### Interface Segregation
- Design focused interfaces rather than large, general-purpose ones
- Clients should not depend on interfaces they don't use
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### Dependency Inversion
- Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
- Use dependency injection for better testability

### Open/Closed Principle
- Open for extension, closed for modification
- Use interfaces and abstract classes for extensibility
- Avoid modifying existing code when adding new features
