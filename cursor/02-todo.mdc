# Task Management Standards

## Task Organization
### Task States
- `[ ]` pending, `[x]` completed, `[~]` in progress, `[!]` blocked

### Task Description Format
- Use action verb + object + detail
- Specify return type for methods
- Specify expected behavior for operations
- Include acceptance criteria

### Task Scope
- Each task must be completable in single development session
- Include all required implementation details
- Specify all dependencies and prerequisites
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable units

### Design Compliance
- TODO documents must only contain implementation tasks for existing design
- No new design content allowed in TODO files
- All tasks must reference only interfaces explicitly defined in design documents
- No speculation or creation of new interfaces in TODO content

## Code Quality Requirements
### Pre-Implementation Checks
1. Review existing code structure and patterns
2. Identify potential refactoring opportunities
3. Plan for maintainable and testable code

### Post-Implementation Checks
1. Run code quality tools on modified files
2. Apply code formatting tools
3. Fix all errors and warnings above threshold
4. Ensure consistent coding style

### Quality Gates
- Code quality score ≥ 9.0 for all modified files
- Consistent formatting applied to all modified files
- No linting errors remain
- All tests pass

## Testing Requirements
### Unit Test Coverage
- Create at least one unit test for each public method
- Create at least one unit test for each public function
- Test normal operation scenarios
- Test error conditions
- Test edge cases

### Test Structure
- Use Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Use descriptive test names: function_condition_expected
- Test one behavior per test method
- Use fixtures for common test data
- Mock external dependencies

## File Organization
### TODO File Structure
- One file per development phase
- Sequential numbering: 1.todo.md, 2.todo.md, etc.
- Each file contains related tasks only
- Split large phases across multiple files when needed

### Task Dependencies
- List prerequisite tasks explicitly
- Specify execution order when required
- Mark blocking dependencies clearly
- Use dependency graphs for complex relationships

## Status Management
### Progress Tracking
- Update task status immediately after completion
- Mark dependent tasks when prerequisites complete
- Use clear status indicators only
- Document completion criteria

### Completion Criteria
- All tasks marked as completed
- All code passes quality gates
- All tests pass
- No blocking dependencies remain
- Documentation updated if needed

## Task Templates
### Feature Implementation Task
```
[ ] Implement [FeatureName]
  - [ ] Create [ComponentName] class
  - [ ] Add [MethodName] method
  - [ ] Write unit tests
  - [ ] Update documentation
  - [ ] Integration testing
```

### Bug Fix Task
```
[ ] Fix [BugDescription]
  - [ ] Reproduce the issue
  - [ ] Identify root cause
  - [ ] Implement fix
  - [ ] Add regression test
  - [ ] Verify fix works
```

### Refactoring Task
```
[ ] Refactor [ComponentName]
  - [ ] Analyze current implementation
  - [ ] Design improved structure
  - [ ] Implement changes incrementally
  - [ ] Update tests
  - [ ] Verify functionality preserved
```
